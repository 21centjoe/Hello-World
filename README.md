I am just learning this stuff.  Hopefully I will be able to write the code shortly with a little bit of luck.  
It is not necessary to do this but I like it.  Do you like it too.  
I am going to need some help probably when I start debugging the program.  
Feel free to contact me through the appropriate channels.
